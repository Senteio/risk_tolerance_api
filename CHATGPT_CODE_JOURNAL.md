CHANGELOG.md → concise, public-facing summary of version-to-version changes.

deployment.md → technical cookbook for releases (no story, just steps).

Code_JOURNAL.md → personal narrative: discoveries, mistakes, fixes, reasoning.

They overlap in content, but not in purpose.

👉 Later, if you want, I can show you a trick: write everything first in the journal, then lift out the “how-to” into deployment.md and the “what changed” into CHANGELOG.md. That way you’re only authoring once.

Here’s a good rule of thumb I recommend for your Code_JOURNAL.md:

1. Entries should be time-bounded

Use clear headers like:

## 2025-09-14 — Fixing CHANGELOG tags


Each entry = one story/problem/solution.

This keeps it navigable even if the file grows to thousands of lines.

2. Keep it narrative, but skim-friendly

Capture “why I tried this, what worked, what failed.”

Use bullet points or small code blocks so future-you can scan.

3. Size guidelines

Per entry: 10–40 lines is healthy (more only if it was a really complex session).

Total file: Hundreds or even thousands of lines is fine — just segment with dated headers.

4. When it does get unwieldy

Split into volumes:

Code_JOURNAL_2025Q1.md
Code_JOURNAL_2025Q2.md


Or archive older entries into journal_archive/.

Keep the current active file lean, with old material safely stored.

You’re treating your repo like a research notebook + professional project at the same time — that’s rare and powerful. With your journal structured this way, you’ll:

Have a personal log of how you solved problems (your “why”).

A deployment.md for repeatability (your “how”).

A changelog for the public view (your “what”).

That’s the same three-layer workflow big engineering teams use — you’re basically running your own “mini software org.” 🚀

When you’re ready, I can help you:

Add that clickable Table of Contents to your journal (auto-generated).

Show you how to archive by quarter so it never feels too heavy.

## For Phase II - pie chart phase:
### First start a branch off the main for phase II
If you create a new branch from main, that branch will include everything you’ve done so far — and you can safely build Phase II (pie chart, Plotly, etc.) on top of it.

That’s exactly how feature branching usually works:

main = stable version

phase-ii (new branch) = experiments / additions

🛠 How to do it

From your project folder in terminal (with venv active or not, doesn’t matter for Git):
```
git checkout -b phase-ii
```

This does two things at once:
Creates a new branch called phase-ii
Switches you onto it

Now any changes you make (installing Plotly, modifying risk_tolerance_app.py) will belong to this branch.

🌱 Workflow suggestion

Stay on phase-ii while you add Plotly + pie chart

Commit and push:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Add Plotly pie chart for portfolio allocation"
git push --set-upstream origin phase-ii
```
When you create a new branch (phase-ii)
By default, Git only makes the branch local.
Git doesn’t automatically know if you want that new branch on GitHub too, or if it’s just an experimental local branch.
So the first time you push a new branch, Git asks you to explicitly set the upstream.
That’s why you had to do:
```
git push --set-upstream origin phase-ii
```
After this one-time setup, you can push/pull from phase-ii with just:
```
git push
git pull
```
Later, when you’re happy, you can merge phase-ii back into main either:

On GitHub (Pull Request, clean & visual)

Or locally with git checkout main && git merge phase-ii
### Now let's install plotly
- while in venv mode, under risk_tolerance_api folder:  import plotly from the terminal
- Got a fatal error in venv mode. venv corrupted - see master journal on how to fix this.
I removed venv and reinstalled it then I:
reinstalled my requirements by:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then I added plotly:
```
pip install plotly
```
Then we froze the dependencies
- run pip freeze to freeze dependencies
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
### How to tag the project at this point (phase-ii)
```
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag -a phase-ii -m "Phase II: pie chart + matplotlib + reqs"
# If you haven't deleted the phase ii branch yet, do that before you push or will get an error
git branch -a
git branch -D phase-ii
git push origin phase-ii
#or push all tags
git push origin --tags
```
### How do I update my tag if I changed something in a phase of my project.
First, delete the local tag
```
git tag -d phase-ii
```
Recreate the latest commit
```
git tag phase-ii
```
Delete the tag on Github
```
git push origin :refs/tags/phase-ii
```
Push the new tag
```
git push origin phase-ii
```
#### This will update the phase-ii tag to point to your latest, cleaned-up commit — with all permalinks included.

### Starting Phase III
- At the point phase-ii worked, start the new branch
```
git checkout -b phase-iii
```
- Double check you are on the branch
```
git branch
```
- you should see:
```
* phase-iii
  main
```
If not then switch branches
```
git switch phase-iii
```
- add then commit any changes you made after the phase-ii tag and before pushing if you did any before the push:
```
git add .
git commit -m "added changes"
```
Then need to push it upstream the first time:
```
git push --set-upstream origin phase-iii
```
## DONT FORGET TO SAVE CHANGES - BEFORE COMMITTING THEM.
#### If a change gets out of sequence from a push, remember this in your bag of tricks:
 From inside the repo root (should be .../risk_tolerance_api)
 ```
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
```
#### See exactly what’s unstaged vs staged
```
git status
git diff                 # unstaged changes
git diff --staged        # staged changes
```

#### Stage the WHOLE file (not just a hunk)
```
git add CHATGPT_CODE_JOURNAL.md
```
#### Commit and confirm the file is included
git commit -m "Journal: update upstream cmd to phase-iii"
git show --name-status HEAD

#### Push to the branch you’re on (phase-iii)
```
git push
```
### Prep for deploy to Streamlit
- Loaded Python 3.12.6. Didn't load newest version because: Most packages (like Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly, etc.) are officially tested with Python 3.11 and 3.12. 3.13 is brand new and may cause compatibility hiccups.

## Finalizing, Merging, Tagging, and deleting onedrive repo
I haven't tagged phase-iii yet, I haven't merged phase-iii to the main, and I haven't deleted the one drive risk_tolerance_repo. Can you assist me with this?
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 13s

Absolutely—here’s a tight, safe sequence to finish Phase III properly: merge → tag → switch Streamlit → clean OneDrive. Follow in order.

1) Finalize Phase III on phase-iii
### make sure you’re on the right branch and clean
git checkout phase-iii
git pull
git status

### (if anything changed) commit & push
git add -A
git commit -m "Phase III: finalize before merge"
git push origin phase-iii


Sanity checks (do these now):

Open the app locally once: streamlit run streamlit_app.py → close it.

Update CHANGELOG.md (ensure the v0.3.0 entry is present) and save.

Verify requirements.txt exists and includes streamlit and other deps.

If you edited CHANGELOG or reqs, commit/push again.

2) Merge phase-iii → main

Option A (recommended): GitHub Pull Request

On GitHub, open a New pull request: base=main, compare=phase-iii.

Ensure the diff looks right → Merge the PR.

Option B (CLI)

git checkout main
git pull
git merge --no-ff phase-iii -m "Merge: Phase III release"
git push origin main

3) Tag the release on main (v0.3.0)
git checkout main
git pull
git tag -a v0.3.0 -m "Phase III release"
git push origin v0.3.0


(If your changelog bottom block has compare links, add the next one later when you cut v0.4.0.)

4) Point Streamlit Cloud to main
- Select Create app
- Select Deploy public app from GitHub
- Fill the form:

    Repository: Senteio/risk_tolerance_api

    Branch: main

    Main file path: frontend/risk_tolerance_app.py

    Rename the app name different than phase-iii

    Deploy


    Confirm the app boots and basic flows work.

5) Clean up phase-iii branch (optional but tidy)
### delete remote branch after merge
git push origin --delete phase-iii
### delete local branch
git branch -d phase-iii
### create next work branch when ready
git checkout -b phase-iv

6) Safely remove the OneDrive repo copy

Goal: remove the duplicate OneDrive working copy so it stops creating .git/index.lock headaches—without losing anything.

A) Confirm where your current working copy lives

git rev-parse --show-toplevel


If the printed path is NOT inside OneDrive (good), proceed.

If it is inside OneDrive, first make a fresh clone somewhere outside OneDrive, verify it works, then decommission the OneDrive copy.

B) Make sure the OneDrive copy has nothing unique
Open a terminal inside the OneDrive copy (the duplicate folder) and run:

git fetch --all
### shows commits you have locally that aren't on GitHub (should be none)
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD
git log --oneline origin/phase-iii..HEAD   # if branch exists locally


If these two commands print nothing, there are no unpushed commits.

C) Decommission the OneDrive copy

Close VS Code and any terminals in that folder.

Pause OneDrive sync (right-click OneDrive icon → Pause).

Rename the folder first (safe rollback):

e.g., risk_tolerance_api_backup_2025-09-12

Resume OneDrive; wait a minute.

After you’ve confirmed your outside-OneDrive repo works and Streamlit is green, delete the renamed backup folder (send to Recycle Bin).

Tip: If Windows blocks deletion, reboot once or run PowerShell as Admin:

Remove-Item "C:\Users\<you>\OneDrive\...path...\risk_tolerance_api_backup_2025-09-12" -Recurse -Force

7) Quick verification checklist

GitHub main shows the Phase III files and the CHANGELOG.md entry for v0.3.0.

GitHub Releases/Tags shows v0.3.0.

Streamlit app is redeployed from main and loads.

No more .git/index.lock errors locally.

## 2025-09-14 - Fixing ChangeLOG tags
## Code_JOURNAL Entry — Fixing Changelog Compare Links & Preparing for Phase IV

### Context
Discovered that CHANGELOG.md compare links (e.g., `v0.2.0...v0.3.0`) showed "Nothing to compare" on GitHub. Needed to align Git tags properly with each phase release.

---

### Problem
- GitHub compare links did not work.
- Root cause: earlier tags (`v0.1.0`, `v0.2.0`) were never created/pushed, so GitHub had no references to diff against.

---

### Successful Steps

#### 1. Verified Current Tags
```bash
git fetch --tags
git tag -l
Confirmed only v0.3.0 existed (tagged on the Phase III merge commit).

2. Found Parent Commit for Phase II
Since Phase III was tagged at merge commit 3730b6a, Phase II = the first parent of that merge.
⚠️ On Windows CMD, ^ is an escape character — must use ~1 instead.

```
git show -s --format=%H 3730b6a~1
```
→ Returned <SHA_PHASE_II>

Tagged Phase II:
```
git tag -a v0.2.0 <SHA_PHASE_II> -m "Phase II release (pre-Phase III)"
git push origin v0.2.0
```
3. Tagged Phase I (Initial MVP)
Phase I = the app before charts, when risk_tolerance_app.py existed at project root.

Find when the file was added:
```
git log --diff-filter=A --reverse --pretty=oneline -- risk_tolerance_app.py
```
→ Took the first commit hash.

Tagged Phase I:
```
git tag -a v0.1.0 <SHA_PHASE_I> -m "Phase I release (initial MVP, risk score only)"
git push origin v0.1.0
```
4. Verified Tags & Compare Links
```
git tag -l -n1
git show --no-patch v0.1.0
git show --no-patch v0.2.0
git show --no-patch v0.3.0
```
On GitHub:
```
.../compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0 → Phase II changes (pie chart, Plotly).

.../compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0 → Phase III changes (frontend restructure + cloud deploy).

Links now render correctly in CHANGELOG.md.

## Phase IV Instructions (for later)
While developing on phase-iv
Keep [Unreleased] section in CHANGELOG.md updated with Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed.

When ready to release:
Merge to main
```
git checkout main && git pull
git merge --no-ff phase-iv -m "Merge: Phase IV release"
git push origin main
```
Cut changelog
Move [Unreleased] into:

## [v0.4.0] - YYYY-MM-DD

Leave a new empty [Unreleased] section at the top.

Tag
```
git tag -a v0.4.0 -m "Phase IV release"
git push origin v0.4.0
```
Update link references at bottom of CHANGELOG.md

```
[Unreleased]: https://github.com/Senteio/risk_tolerance_api/compare/v0.4.0...HEAD
[v0.4.0]: https://github.com/Senteio/risk_tolerance_api/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0
[v0.3.0]: https://github.com/Senteio/risk_tolerance_api/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0
[v0.2.0]: https://github.com/Senteio/risk_tolerance_api/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0
[v0.1.0]: https://github.com/Senteio/risk_tolerance_api/releases/tag/v0.1.0
```
Deploy prod from main

Streamlit Cloud → Create app → Deploy public app from GitHub

Repo: Senteio/risk_tolerance_api

Branch: main

File path: frontend/risk_tolerance_app.py

URL: reuse prod URL (rename/delete old app if needed)

# Lessons Learned
Always tag after merging into main so tags align with deployed code.

Windows CMD requires ~1 instead of ^1 when referencing parent commits.

Keep [Unreleased] → new version section workflow consistent in CHANGELOG.md.

Append link references at the very bottom of CHANGELOG.md so GitHub compare links always resolve.

## 2025-09-14 I installed Node.js on thinkpad so that I could use terminal to 

```
npm install -g doctoc
```
then 
```
doctoc Code_JOURNAL.md --github
```
the node.js install did not work.

## [2025-09-17] Workspace & Repo Cleanup

### 1. Deleted stale branches & repos
- Removed the **`phase-iii` branch** after completing Streamlit Cloud deployment (kept history clean).  
- Deleted the duplicate **risk_tolerance_api repo** that had been syncing to OneDrive (to avoid sync conflicts with GitHub).  

---

### 2. New folder layout
Set up a clean hierarchy under `C:\dev\repos\`:

C:\dev\repos
└── financial_workspace\ ← container folder (not a repo)
└── risk_tolerance_api\ ← actual repo


- `repos` holds all GitHub projects.  
- `financial_workspace` is a **container folder** for financial repos/projects.  
- `risk_tolerance_api` remains a proper GitHub repo inside the container.  
- This avoids cloud sync issues and keeps repos organized in one place.  

---

### 3. Multi-root workspace setup in VS Code
Created a `Financial.code-workspace` file in `C:\dev\repos\`:

```json
{
  "folders": [
    { "path": "C:\\dev\\repos\\financial_workspace" }
  ],
  "settings": {
    "files.exclude": {
      "**/.venv": true,
      "**/__pycache__": true,
      "**/.git": true
    }
  }
}
```
Loads the entire financial_workspace container, so all repos inside (like risk_tolerance_api) appear in VS Code automatically.

Keeps things future-proof as more repos are added — no need to edit JSON again.

4. Opening the workspace from JSON
Steps:

File → Open Workspace from File…

Select Financial.code-workspace.

Result: VS Code Explorer shows the financial_workspace container and all repos/projects inside (e.g., risk_tolerance_api).

5. Desktop shortcut for instant access
Created a Windows shortcut:

swift
Copy code
"C:\Users\steve\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe" "C:\dev\repos\Financial.code-workspace"
Named it Financial Workspace.

Pinned to Taskbar for one-click access.

Opens directly into the workspace without navigating through folder layers.

✅ Key Takeaway
Now running a clean, portable dev environment:

Organized repo hierarchy with a container folder for financial projects.

Single JSON workspace definition to auto-load all repos inside.

One-click shortcut for daily development.

Avoids OneDrive sync issues.

Git history cleaned up (removed stale branch).

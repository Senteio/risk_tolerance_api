Notes: Phase II added matplotlib integration, updated requirements, and pie chart visualization.



**Key Points from README:**
- **Purpose:** REST API that returns a 0â€“100 risk score and risk band (Conservative / Moderate / Aggressive).
- **Setup:**  
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate   # or source .venv/bin/activate on Mac/Linux
  pip install -r requirements.txt
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn index:app --reload --port 8000
Config: .env variables like MODEL_PATH, LOG_LEVEL, ALLOWED_ORIGINS.

Endpoints overview: /assess, /health.

Constraints: Stateless; no persistence in Phase I.

API Contract (from index.py):

http
Copy
Edit
POST /assess
Request: { age:int, horizon_years:int, loss_tolerance:string, volatility_pref:string }
Response: { score:int, band:string, explanations:string[] }

GET /health
Response: { status:"ok" }
Terminal Commands:

bash

# Run locally
uvicorn index:app --reload --port 8000

# Run tests

## For Phase II - pie chart phase:
### First start a branch off the main for phase II
If you create a new branch from main, that branch will include everything youâ€™ve done so far â€” and you can safely build Phase II (pie chart, Plotly, etc.) on top of it.

Thatâ€™s exactly how feature branching usually works:

main = stable version

phase-ii (new branch) = experiments / additions

ðŸ›  How to do it

From your project folder in terminal (with venv active or not, doesnâ€™t matter for Git):
```
git checkout -b phase-ii
```

This does two things at once:
Creates a new branch called phase-ii
Switches you onto it

Now any changes you make (installing Plotly, modifying risk_tolerance_app.py) will belong to this branch.

ðŸŒ± Workflow suggestion

Stay on phase-ii while you add Plotly + pie chart

Commit and push:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Add Plotly pie chart for portfolio allocation"
git push --set-upstream origin phase-ii
```
When you create a new branch (phase-ii)
By default, Git only makes the branch local.
Git doesnâ€™t automatically know if you want that new branch on GitHub too, or if itâ€™s just an experimental local branch.
So the first time you push a new branch, Git asks you to explicitly set the upstream.
Thatâ€™s why you had to do:
```
git push --set-upstream origin phase-ii
```
After this one-time setup, you can push/pull from phase-ii with just:
```
git push
git pull
```
Later, when youâ€™re happy, you can merge phase-ii back into main either:

On GitHub (Pull Request, clean & visual)

Or locally with git checkout main && git merge phase-ii
### Now let's install plotly
- while in venv mode, under risk_tolerance_api folder:  import plotly from the terminal
- Got a fatal error in venv mode. venv corrupted - see master journal on how to fix this.
I removed venv and reinstalled it then I:
reinstalled my requirements by:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then I added plotly:
```
pip install plotly
```
Then we froze the dependencies
- run pip freeze to freeze dependencies
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
### How to tag the project at this point (phase-ii)
```
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag -a phase-ii -m "Phase II: pie chart + matplotlib + reqs"
# If you haven't deleted the phase ii branch yet, do that before you push or will get an error
git branch -a
git branch -D phase-ii
git push origin phase-ii
#or push all tags
git push origin --tags
```

## For Phase II - pie chart phase:
### First start a branch off the main for phase II
If you create a new branch from main, that branch will include everything you’ve done so far — and you can safely build Phase II (pie chart, Plotly, etc.) on top of it.

That’s exactly how feature branching usually works:

main = stable version

phase-ii (new branch) = experiments / additions

🛠 How to do it

From your project folder in terminal (with venv active or not, doesn’t matter for Git):
```
git checkout -b phase-ii
```

This does two things at once:
Creates a new branch called phase-ii
Switches you onto it

Now any changes you make (installing Plotly, modifying risk_tolerance_app.py) will belong to this branch.

🌱 Workflow suggestion

Stay on phase-ii while you add Plotly + pie chart

Commit and push:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Add Plotly pie chart for portfolio allocation"
git push --set-upstream origin phase-ii
```
When you create a new branch (phase-ii)
By default, Git only makes the branch local.
Git doesn’t automatically know if you want that new branch on GitHub too, or if it’s just an experimental local branch.
So the first time you push a new branch, Git asks you to explicitly set the upstream.
That’s why you had to do:
```
git push --set-upstream origin phase-ii
```
After this one-time setup, you can push/pull from phase-ii with just:
```
git push
git pull
```
Later, when you’re happy, you can merge phase-ii back into main either:

On GitHub (Pull Request, clean & visual)

Or locally with git checkout main && git merge phase-ii
### Now let's install plotly
- while in venv mode, under risk_tolerance_api folder:  import plotly from the terminal
- Got a fatal error in venv mode. venv corrupted - see master journal on how to fix this.
I removed venv and reinstalled it then I:
reinstalled my requirements by:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then I added plotly:
```
pip install plotly
```
Then we froze the dependencies
- run pip freeze to freeze dependencies
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
### How to tag the project at this point (phase-ii)
```
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag -a phase-ii -m "Phase II: pie chart + matplotlib + reqs"
# If you haven't deleted the phase ii branch yet, do that before you push or will get an error
git branch -a
git branch -D phase-ii
git push origin phase-ii
#or push all tags
git push origin --tags
```
Open two terminals and run things again:
Backend:
```
uvicorn index:app --reload
```
And Front end in the second terminal
UI - User Interface:
```
streamlit run risk_tolerance_app.py
```

why the . before the \venv\Scripts\activate
ChatGPT said:

Great catch 👌 — the . before \venv\Scripts\activate isn’t just decoration, it tells PowerShell “run this script in the current shell session.”

Here’s why:

On Windows (PowerShell), to activate a venv you do:

.\venv\Scripts\activate

The leading .\ means “look in the current directory for this file.” Without it, PowerShell doesn’t know where to find activate.

On Linux / Mac (bash/zsh), the equivalent is:

source venv/bin/activate


(the source command does the same as the . operator in bash).

So in short:

. (or .\) = “execute this script from right here.”

venv\Scripts\activate = the path to the activation script.

⚡ If you just typed venv\Scripts\activate in PowerShell, it would try to execute it as a program, not a script, and fail. The .\ tells it “it’s in this folder, run it in this session.”

why do i go in and out of cmd prompt and powershell?
ChatGPT said:

Ah, that’s a great question — and you’re not alone in wondering! It happens a lot in VS Code and Windows setups. Here’s why you sometimes feel like you’re “jumping” between cmd.exe and PowerShell:

1. VS Code defaults

VS Code’s built-in terminal defaults to PowerShell on Windows.

But if you explicitly open a different terminal (like Command Prompt), or if a tutorial assumed cmd.exe, you’ll see different syntax rules.

2. The prompt looks similar

In PowerShell, you’ll see something like:

PS C:\Users\steve\...


In cmd.exe, you’ll see just:

C:\Users\steve\...


It’s subtle — so it’s easy to not notice when you’ve switched.

3. Activation scripts differ

PowerShell needs .\venv\Scripts\activate

cmd.exe needs venv\Scripts\activate

Git Bash (if you use it) needs source venv/Scripts/activate

So if you type the wrong one for the wrong shell, you’ll get errors.

4. Why you go “in and out”

Sometimes VS Code auto-opens PowerShell even if last time you used cmd.

Sometimes you manually changed the terminal dropdown (little “+” in the terminal, choose cmd, PowerShell, or Git Bash).

Sometimes a guide you’re following assumes one shell but you’re actually in the other.

✅ My recommendation for sanity:

Pick one shell (PowerShell is fine, since it’s VS Code’s default).

Always use the PowerShell versions of commands.
### I defaulted for VS code to use Power Shell.
- I went to command pallet/default profile/powershell
### After run 1 of front end, got error that matplotlib was not installed, so I installed that:
```
pip install matplotlib
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
Worked like a champ!
#### Note while the front end and the back end are running, the terminal freezes from any inputs. To unfreeze and get back to prompts - Ctrl C

### Push phase ii to the branch
check which branch you are on:
```
git branch
```
Seeing a star on the branch name means it is active
if you’re not on your Phase II branch, switch:
```
git checkout phase-ii
```
Add, commit, and push to that branch:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Phase II: added matplotlib, updated requirements, and tested pie chart"
git push origin phase-ii
```
### After we push the project to the branch, when we are done and happy with the branch, we will run a Pull Request (PR):
Go to GitHub

Open your repo in GitHub (same repo where main lives).

GitHub should automatically detect that you pushed a new branch and show a yellow banner like:
“phase-ii had recent pushes. Compare & pull request.”

Click that button.

3. Create the Pull Request

Base branch: main (this is where changes will go).

Compare branch: phase-ii (your feature branch).

Add a title (e.g., “Phase II Update: Matplotlib + Requirements Fix”).

In the description, summarize what you did (installed matplotlib, updated requirements.txt, tested pie chart).

Click “Create pull request.”

4. Merge into Main

On the next screen, review the changes.

If it looks good, click “Merge pull request” → “Confirm merge.”

Done ✅ — your main branch now has the Phase II updates.

5. (Optional) Clean Up

After merging, you can delete the phase-ii branch on GitHub.
Locally, you can also switch back to main and pull the latest:
```
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```
This local pull …it updates your local main to match GitHub’s latest version.
That way, the next time you start a feature branch, you’re starting from the up-to-date main instead of an old copy.

#### To recap pull and Pull Request:
```
git pull
```
This is a Git command you run locally.

It fetches the latest changes from GitHub (remote) and then merges them into your local branch.

If you already have local changes, Git will try to merge both sets. If they conflict, you’ll have to resolve them.

It does not overwrite everything blindly — Git is designed to merge, not destroy work.

So:
```
git pull origin main
```

= “get the latest version of main from GitHub and merge it into my local main.”

🔹 Pull Request (PR)

This is a GitHub feature, not a local command.

A PR says: “Please merge my branch into another branch” (usually feature → main).

It’s a way to review, discuss, and approve changes before they land in main.

After the PR is merged, the remote main has your changes — but your local main won’t until you run git pull.

✅ So to your question:

A git pull brings remote → local (merging, not overwriting).

A pull request merges one branch into another on GitHub (remote → remote).
